bib2ml (ex bib2html) from Arakhne.org is a Perl script which permits to create a set of HTML pages, an XML file or a SQL script from a BibTeX file.
It proposes a convenient look and a lot of features (PDF downloading, scientifical domain tree...).

DISLAIMER FROM AUTHORS:
Iâ€™ve come across mention of other bib2html programs. This program is in no way related to any of them. Other BibTeX-to-HTML tools (non-exhautive list) :
  * bib2html from Kiri Wagstaff
  * bib2html from David Kotz (also on CTAN)
  * bib2html from Eric Marchand
  * bib2html from Mark Moll and Patrick Riley

See ./doc/index.html for more details.
